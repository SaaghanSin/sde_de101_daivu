As a data engineer hired to enable data analytics, I believe that the key to success lies in understanding the specific data needs of the business. Rather than focusing solely on a broad business case, my approach is to identify the exact data requirements of the stakeholders. By gathering detailed information about the data they need, I can create views or grant appropriate access privileges to ensure they have direct access to the necessary data.
This approach allows me to provide tailored solutions that directly address the data needs of the business. By focusing on the data requirements, I can streamline the process, reduce unnecessary complexity, and ensure that the stakeholders can easily access and utilize the data for their analytical purposes. Once I have a clear understanding of the data requirements, I can expand my work step by step:
 - Building an overview for my data architecture, as create a comprehensive overview of the data architecture that will support the business needs. This includes identifying data sources, data flow, storage solutions, and data access mechanisms. The architecture should be scalable, flexible, and capable of integrating with existing systems.
 - Forcast what data tools need for my architecture, including data warehouses, ETL tools, data work control. Calculate the costs associated with these tools, considering both initial setup and ongoing operational expenses. Present this information to the customer to ensure alignment on budget and resources.
